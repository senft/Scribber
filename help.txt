What is Scribber?
============
Scribber is a simple, lightweigt **text editor** that tries not to keep you from writing your important texts. Scribber does not distract you, but makes you **focus on writing**, plain writing. No tweaking the spacing here, or changing the font size there.

Markdown Highlighting
-----------------------------
Scribber uses a slightly modified version of Markdown. Since Markdown is targeted on creating HTML-Code for Content-Managment-Systems it's not what we want in Scribber. For example we don't need hyperlinks or horizontal lines, but on the other hand we *do* need footnotes and tables. So what do we have in Scribber?

### Basic decoration
*italic*, **bold**, _underline_, ***bolditalic***

### Lists
##### Unsorted lists
* This list is unsorted
* This is the second item. Lists can automatically be wrapped. Scribber doesn't care if the line is too long. No need for you to wrap the lines by yourself. But if you want to you can and indent the next line.
* This is a nice list.

#### Sorted lists
1. This list is sorted.
5. The numbers in front dont matter at all.
2. This is a nice list.

### Blockquotes
> This is a blockquote. It's quite simmilar to a list. This can automatically be wrapped or be wrapped and indented by hand.
