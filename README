Scribber is a simple text editor that focuses on minimalism.

    Some features:
        * Highlithing the current sentence
        * Realtime Markdown

# TODO:
    * Decide wether i want to implement spellcheck or not
    * When resizing the window, update cursor position
    * When moving the cursor while it is out of focus
        refocus to cursor (or does this get eliminated with
        preceding point?)
