**Scribber** is a simple text editor that focuses on minimalism.

# Some features:

* Highlight the current sentence
* Markdown syntax hilighting
* Minimalistic UI that lets you focus on writing your text
* Export to PDF

# Dependencies:

* GTK+
* pdflatex

# TODO:

* Optimize syntax hilighting (gets very slow on large texts)
* Add some Markdown features
* Export to ODT
