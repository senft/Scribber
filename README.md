#Scribber

**Scribber** is a simple text editor that focuses on minimalism.

# Features:

* Highlight the current sentence
* Markdown syntax highlighting
* Minimalistic UI that lets you focus on writing your text

# Dependencies:

* GTK
* Pango

# TODO:

* Optimize syntax highlighting (gets very slow on large texts)
* Add some Markdown features (footnotes, ...)
* Export to ODT/PDF
* Implement a mechanism to quickly jump between headings. Maybe provide a
  overview of all headings and their hierachy
