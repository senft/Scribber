#Scribber

**Scribber** is a simple text editor that focuses on minimalism. (Screenshot at the bottom)


# Features:

* Highlight the current sentence
* Markdown syntax hilighting
* Minimalistic UI that lets you focus on writing your text
* Export to PDF

# Dependencies:

* GTK+
* pdflatex
* python-markdown

# TODO:

* Optimize syntax hilighting (gets very slow on large texts)
* Add some Markdown features (footnotes, ...)
* Export to ODT
* When hovering an image-code display the image in a tooltip
* Implement a mechanis to quickly jump between headings. Maybe provide a overview of all headings and their hierachy
